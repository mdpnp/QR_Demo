<h1>QR Codes for Medical Device Point-of-Care Product Information</h1>

<h2>Problem</h2>
<p>The information required for correctly and efficiently using a medical device is not always available at the point of care/use. Paper instructions are often discarded when products are unpacked in part because they are not permitted in many clinical care environments. Often, instructions are only available in sterile package.
</p>

<p>There is a need to read <em>quickly accessible and easily understandable</em> medical device information prior to, or during the, use of product.
</p>

<h2>Solution</h2>
<p><b>QR Code Pilot Project:</b> Evaluate <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qr_code">QR codes</a> for electronic access to device use information at the point of care/use.
</p>

<p>Consider QR Codes for point-of-care access to key information<span id="notes"> <a href="http://mdpnp.org/APSF_QR_Demo.html">(From Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation Workshop recommendations, Oct 2013, J. Goldman)</a></span>
<ul>
	<li>Point-of-care specific instructions</li>
	<li>Informational web sites</li>
	<li>Current/updated warnings/cautions/recalls</li>
	<li>Form to report product problems, ask questions</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
QR codes could be attached to medical devices to point to online resources (i.e. documentation, video tutorials, quick reference guides/tables, etc.) that would help clinicians and other professionals to understand, operate, manipulate or configure a device, making access to medical device documentation easier and more convenient. Typically a smartphone would be used as a QR-code scanner, displaying the coded information and converting it to some useful form (such as a standard URL for a website, thereby obviating the need for a user to type it into a web browser)
</p>

<p>Eventually, QR codes may become an alternative method of providing instructions for use and clinically important device characteristics, at the point of care/use.
</p>



<h3>What are QR Codes?</h3>
<div>

<div style="float:left; width:85%" >
<p >A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qr_code">QR code</a> (abbreviated from Quick Response Code) is the trademark for a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) first designed for the automotive industry in Japan (Invented in 1994). A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. 
</p>
<p>
	QR codes can be found almost anywhere where they are suitable to be scanned. According to <a href="http://www.pewinternet.org/2015/04/01/us-smartphone-use-in-2015/" target="_blank">this source</a> nearly two-thirds (64%) of Americans own a smartphone of some kind, and for many users these devices are their key entry point to the online world. With a wealth of bar-code reader apps for almost every smarmtphone platform, most smartphones have the potential to scan QR codes.
</p>

</a>



</div>

<br/>
<p>
	 QR codes on products or product packaging can bring a lot of information to the user do a number of things depending on the product, from linking to recipies or nutrition facts for food based products to giving additional information, videos, photos, instructional demos, user reviews or discounts, ultimately building the consumers' confidence in the product.
</p>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>

<p>The Internet is not the place to find proper medical advice. Thus said, it is full with (or can be used to publicly share) learning materials and other resources that would allow clinical professionals and caregivers to deliver a better care. See below some examples of information currently publicly available on the Internet:</p>

			<p>
			<b>Current State:</b> A 38-year-old female with primary biliary cirrhosis is brought in for a deceased-donor liver transplant at 1am. The anesthesiologist prepares an operating room for the liver transplant. During the OR set-up, he realizes that the rapid transfusion medical device <b>needs a new cartridge installed</b>. There is no anesthesia technician available at this hour, so the anesthesiologist fumbles through directions on the packaging to try to load the cartridge. He also searches the web for instructions on how to assemble the device. 
			</p>

			<p>
			After 40 extra minutes of searching for, reading directions and looking for help, he finally assembles the device correctly and brings the patient into the OR for the liver transplant. The organ has an increased ischemic time of 40 min due to the anesthesia set-up delay.
			</p>

			<p><b>Proposed State:</b> All the manufacturer XYZ rapid transfusion medical device cartridge's packaging comes with a QR code printed on the front. The anesthesiologist scans the QR code with his smartphone camera (ie: iPhone or Android) and the QR code brings him to the exact link and short video of how to quickly set up a device of this kind.

	<div style ="float:left;width:85%">
		<p>
		QR codes are placed in disposable items, to warn about a certain condition or to explain how to replace the disposable. QR codes would alert of components or materials that could jeopardize patients with allergies (i.e. a mask containing latex) or could point to tutorials showing how to replace the disposable part (i.e. in cartridges or drugs packaging).
		</p>

		<p> If the drug is unfamiliar to the clinician, she can scan the QR code and the code will link her to a website depicting how to properly prepare and administer the drug. The cartridge packaging information could lead to a tutorial explaining how to replace the cartridge and set up the device.

<div id="tab4" class="hidden" >
<p>Caregivers will scan QR codes to receive information and instructional videos for caring for those in their charge. This would offer valuable information to patients or medical device users who do not have a clinical background or received clinical training (for example those carrying a holter monitor or a Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) system).
</p>

<p><b>Current State:</b> A patient needs to take home a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holter_monitor">holter monitor</a> to monitor his/her heart activity for one week. A nurse puts the electrodes on the patient's chest and activates the device. All the patient is told is that he/she should not manipulate the device and just come back after 24 to 48 hours hours to return the recorder.
</p>

<p><b>Proposed State:</b> The holter monitor has a QR code that links to a website with useful information for patients carrying a holter monitor. 
This website does not teach the patient how to manipulate the holter, but gives some advice about optimizing the experience and the results gathered 
with the device.

<ul>
	<li>The website reminds the patient not to get the monitor wet and to take a sponge bath instead of showering or bathing if needed.</li>
	<li>The linked website could have a service that would allow the patient to keep a diary of their activity. It could allow the patient to enter information or select between a list of symptoms (fainting, feeling dizzy, paltitations, etc.) that would improve the quality of the information gathered.</li>
	<li>The link could have useful contact information so the patient can schedule the return of the receiver or call for assistante if one electrode falls off or has a problem or question about the device.</li>
</ul>

	<li>Rapid access to clinically useful information</li>
	<li>Information on web site can be updated easily</li>
</ul>

<h3>Generating QR Codes</h3>

<p>To generate a QR code, type your text on the text box below and click enter</p>


<p><input id="text" type="text" value="http://mdpnp.org" style="width:80%" /> <br/>
select the size of the image
<select id="sizeoption">
	<option value="64">64 x 64</option>
