	<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
	<h4><span id="FAQ1">Q: Can you do closed circuit anesthesia with the drager apollo piston ventilator?</span></h4>
	<p>	A: The Apollo uses a piston ventilator, which eliminates the need for drive gas. However, the fresh gas flow and anesthetic vapor function similar to the Fabius GS and older Draeger products.  There should always be some fresh gas flow to replace consumed Oxygen and to replensish lost volume from leaks.
