QR Codes for Medical Device Point-of-Care Product Information

is a demonstration about the concept of the possibilities of using QR codes to enable acces to online documentation at the point of care for medical devices.

This demonstration has been developed and in hosted by the [Medical Device 'Plug and Play' Program][1].

**Objective:**  Make access to medical device documentation easier and more convenient by using QR codes. QR codes could be attached to medical devices to point to online resources (i.e. documentation, video tutorials, quick reference guides/tables, etc.) that would help clinicians and other professionals to understand, operate, manipulate or configure a device.
